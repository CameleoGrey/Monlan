# Monlan
Monlan is a framework to build your own FOREX trading robot based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

# Key features
1) Each robot, that you'll make by this framework, will stand into long/short position until best moment to close.
2) Each robot is composition of Deep Reinforcement Learning agents (opener + buyer and seller) that are learning simultaniously.
3) You don't need to know any trading strategy. Robots are learning best strategy directly from data.
4) There is a lot of feature generators that you can combine with each other.
5) You can try your best robot on your MT5 account (There is no warranty that it will give you profit. So use only at your risk.)
