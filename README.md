# Monlan
Monlan is a framework to build your own FOREX trading robot based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

# Key features
1) Each robot, that you'll make by this framework, will stand into long/short position until best moment to close.
2) Each robot is composition of Deep Reinforcement Learning agents (opener + buyer and seller) that are learning simultaniously.
3) You don't need to know any trading strategy. Robots are learning best strategy directly from data.
4) There is a lot of feature generators that you can combine with each other.
5) You can try your best robot on your MT5 account (Try them on demo account first, because there is no warranty that it will give you profit. So use only at your risk.)
6) Try an unique opportunity to work with prices as with text by using word2vec and hierarchical 3D convolution neural network.
7) Enjoy! And remember: when starting to work in the financial markets, make sure that you are aware of the risks associated with trading with leverage, and that you have a sufficient level of training. You shall assume the risk of financial loss caused by actions of robots that you've created by this framework.
